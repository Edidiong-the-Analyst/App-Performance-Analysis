## Objectives

- Identify upgrade drivers through feature usage analysis  
- Understand churn patterns and recommend retention strategies  
- Assess pricing, revenue generation, and user segmentation  
- Deliver targeted recommendations to boost conversions & engagement  

---

## Business Challenges
- Low Free-to-Premium conversion (<20%)  
- High churn rate (29.9%), especially among Free users and ages 50–64  
- Underutilization of advanced features (Analytics, Personalized Plans)  
- Value perception gap between Free and Premium  
- Lifecycle stagnation (70% of users never change plans)  

---

## Key Findings
- **User Base:** 10,000 users → 69.8% Free, 30.2% Premium  
- **Churn:** 70.5% of churners are Free users; older demographics most vulnerable  
- **Revenue:** £60,583 (2023); average Premium payment ~£20  
- **Feature Use:** Workout & Nutrition tracking dominate; Advanced Analytics & Personalized Plans drive retention  
- **Regional Trends:** Manchester = highest active users; Glasgow = highest churn  

---

## Insights
- Engagement matters more than price  
- Upgrade triggers are missing (no nudges/milestones)  
- Free users lack exposure to retention-driving features  
- Older users (50–64) churn most → need tailored onboarding/content  
- Lifecycle inertia: majority of users remain static in their plans  

---

## Recommendations
- **Feature Exposure:** 7-day Premium trials, UI prompts for advanced features  
- **New Tier:** Introduce “Basic Plus” (~£9.99/month) bridging Free & Premium  
- **Churn Reduction:** Exit surveys, segmented win-back campaigns, loyalty offers  
- **Lifecycle Marketing:** Progress-based triggers, gamified feature unlocks  
- **Regional/Demographic Focus:** Senior-friendly UI, location-based campaigns  
- **Pricing Tests:** A/B test messaging, seasonal offers, group/family plans
